## Installation and use
To use this program, simply navigate to the [Release](https://github.com/JulianOzelRose/TombExtract/tree/master/TombExtract/bin/x64/Release)
folder, then download `TombExtract.exe`. Once downloaded, click the "..." button next to source file textbox to select the savegame source. Then click the "..." button
next to the destination file to select your savegame file. It should be located in:

`C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\TRX\77777777777777777\savegame.dat`.

Just replace "USERNAME" with your username, and "77777777777777777" with whatever numeric ID you see in that folder. Use the checklist on the left to select which savegames
you would like to transfer/convert. The buttons below allow the check list allow you to specify whether or not you would like to convert your savegames. Select the relevant
conversion, or leave it at "No" to transfer them as is. Click "Extract" to transfer the savegames, and the program will begin extraction. If you are transferring many savegames,
it may take a minute to complete. The progress bar at the bottom will indicate how far along the process is.
